# Choro Flow

An experiment to adapt the fantastic Piano Flow to Brazilian music.

# Piano Flow
A music game follows the piano flows. Its rhythm mode inspired by Touch Pianist, thanks to Batuhan Bozkurt. The main purpose I made it was to achieve a dream of my youth and to help me practice the fundamentals of MUG.

I need to be honest with you, the game has a bad playability which can't make you feel completely immersed with simple interaction. Maybe it will improve your gameplay through a virtual reality headset, but I think the best experience is on a real piano nowadays.

## Run on Local
``` bash
$ git clone git@github.com:SuneBear/Piano-Flow.git
$ cd Piano-Flow
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

The structure is a experimental combination of SPA based on Vue 2 and MUG based on Pixi.js, MIDI.js, etc. They are basically independent, but using the shared assets and services.

## Browser Compatibility
The game was developed in Chrome 54 (Mac OS X) without cross-browser testing. I am sure it works on webkit-based browsers such as Chrome, Safari. Hold on, there are so many weird questions that I have not met yet if you play it in other browser/device. Feel free to raise an issue, let's make it work first.

## Further Improvements
- Brand Redesign & UI Redesign & Animation Tuning
- Gameplay: Add some different modes
- Music: Optimize timbre & rhythm
- Refactor game, make code more abstract :(
